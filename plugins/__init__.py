# ALL PLUGINS SHOULD BE A SUBCLASS OF PluginBase AND IMPLEMENT METHODS AS NEEDED BASED ON THE SIGNATURES FROM THE BASE.

# Import your plugins here, for example:
# from .plugin_example import PluginExample

PLUGINS = [
    # Create an object for each of your plugins here. For example, a plugin with the classname "PluginExample"
    # would have the following line:
    # PluginExample(),
]
